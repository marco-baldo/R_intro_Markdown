# Introduction

This document provides an explanation of the linear regression model.

## Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model is expressed by the following equation:

\[ \hat{y}_t = a + b_1 \cdot x_{1t} + b_2 \cdot x_{2t} + b_3 \cdot x_{3t} \]

where:

- \( \hat{y}_t \) represents the predicted or estimated value of the dependent variable at time \( t \).
- \( a \) denotes the intercept, signifying the estimated value of \( y_t \) when all explanatory variables are zero.
- \( b_1, b_2, \) and \( b_3 \) are the coefficients representing the estimated change in \( y_t \) for a one-unit change in \( x_{1t}, x_{2t}, \) and \( x_{3t} \) respectively.

## Conclusion

This model captures the linear relationship between the dependent variable \( y_t \) and the explanatory variables \( x_{1t}, x_{2t}, \) and \( x_{3t} \), with corresponding coefficients.
